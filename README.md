* Adding the above to your `~/.bashrc` file will require `source ~/.bashrc`

### Running the code
``` shell
go run main.go

2. Package Management Tool: go mod
3. Code Format Tool: golangci-lint@1.55.2
4. Static Analysis Tool: golangci-lint@1.55.2
5. CI Tool: CircleCI@2.1

### Structure

``` shell
$ tree
.
|____go.mod         # dependencies
|____LICENSE		
|____Makefile       # make test, fmtâ€¦.
|____README.md
|____.gitignore
